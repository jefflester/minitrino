## CLI Changes and Additions

- Removed enormous and unsightly environment variable string preceding `docker
  compose up` commands. It is no longer required since all Minitrino and shell
  environment variables are sourced and provided to the subprocess that executes
  the command.
- The `remove` command now logs removed images and volumes at the `info` level,
  meaning `-v` is no longer a required argument to see which objects are
  removed.
- Added full command output for commands that fail to error log.

## Library Changes and Additions

- Added named volumes for data persistence to all catalog modules (except `Db2`)
  and modified the relevant bootstrap scripts to be idempotent.

## Other

- N/A
