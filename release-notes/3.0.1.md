## CLI Changes and Additions

### Configuration File Improvements

- **Quote stripping in config files**: Configuration values in `minitrino.cfg`
  can now include single or double quotes without causing parse errors. Quotes
  are automatically stripped when values are loaded, making config files more
  flexible and editor-friendly.

  **Example:**

  ```ini
  [config]
  LIB_PATH="/home/user/minitrino-lib"
  CLUSTER_NAME='my-cluster'
  IMAGE=trino
  ```

  All three formats above now work correctly, with quotes automatically removed
  during parsing. Previously, quoted values would fail to parse or include the
  quotes in the actual value.

## Other

### Documentation

- **ReadTheDocs configuration fix**: Updated `.readthedocs.yaml` to use
  `extra_requirements` instead of deprecated `extras` field, resolving
  documentation build failures.
