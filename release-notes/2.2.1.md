## CLI Changes and Additions

- Updated environment variable sourcing logic to always check for `DOCKER_HOST`,
  `CONFIG_PROPERTIES`, and `JVM_CONFIG`. These variables will be sources from
  `--env` options fed to the CLI or from variables set in the user's shell.
- Updated `minitrino modules ${module} --json` to print raw JSON data to the
  terminal without any log level indicators (`[i]`, `[v]`, etc).

## Library Changes and Additions

- N/A

## Other

- Updated `actions/setup-python` to `v5` in relevant workflows.
