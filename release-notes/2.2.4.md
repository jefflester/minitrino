## CLI Changes and Additions

- Update Click dependency to latest release `8.1.8`.

## Library Changes and Additions

- Added `results-cache` and `faker` modules. (#99, #100)
- Changed minimum SEP version to 443-e and default version to 468-e.2.
- Updated image's `install.sh` script to determine arch type––required to fetch
  correct release tarball from S3. (#97)
- Added temporary workaround for working with legacy and native S3 filesystems
  in `hive`, `delta-lake`, `iceberg`, and `cache-service` modules. Trino-native
  filesystem plugins were enabled by default with release 458 (see:
  [Trino](https://trino.io/docs/458/release/release-458.html) /
  [Starburst](https://docs.starburst.io/458-e/release/release-458-e.html#breaking-changes)
  release notes), so legacy properties in >= 458 SEP versions need to be
  replaced with native properties, and in <= 457 releases, legacy properties can
  continue to be used.
