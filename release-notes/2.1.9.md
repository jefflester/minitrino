## Library Changes and Additions

- Bumped minimum SEP version to 429-e
- Added `mariadb` catalog module
- Added `http-server.authentication.allow-insecure-over-http=true` to
  `config.properties` file. This allows unauthenticated access over HTTP, which
  ensures that bootstrap scripts, like those from the `cache-service` module,
  can execute even if an authenticator is enabled.
- Added a named `catalogs` volume to the root Trino service in
  `docker-compose.yml`. This allows any module to mount a catalog properties
  file to `/etc/starburst/catalog/` through an init container by (1) mounting
  the properties file and the named `catalogs` volume to the init container and
  (2) copying the properties file to `/etc/starburst/catalog/`. This is
  beneficial, as these catalog properties files can now be edited inside the
  container without modifying the source file on the host's filesystem.
- Added a bootstrap script to the `biac` module. The script appends certain
  catalog properties with security config that forces the catalog to use
  Starburst's BIAC authorization.
