# Hive-HMS Module
This module uses a Hive metastore container along with a Postgres container for the metastore's backend storage. Using Minipresto's configuration, you can input AWS credentials to link the module to a an S3 bucket for data storage, reading, and writing. Removing the volume associated with the Postgres container will effectively remove your metastore's database, so only remove the volume if you are prepared to lose all of your metadata.
